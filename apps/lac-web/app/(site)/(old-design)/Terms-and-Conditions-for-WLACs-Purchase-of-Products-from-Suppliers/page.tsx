              paying only for any Products retained and returning the balance at
              Supplier&apos;s expense, if: (a) Supplier breaches its
              representations, warranties, covenants or agreements provided in
              these Terms and Conditions or provided in other agreements, Orders
              or contracts with WLAC; (b) Products received do not conform to

            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Supplier grants WLAC and its affiliates the non-exclusive,
              perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free right and license to use, copy
              and display any of Supplier&apos;s trademarks applicable to the
              Products, and all Product information, data, images, Supplier
              publishes or furnishes to WLAC during the term of the Order
              (“Supplier Content”), all of which, Supplier represents and
              warrants, will be accurate and complete. Supplier agrees to
              revise, update, and resubmit Supplier Content promptly upon
              discovering it is inaccurate or incomplete.
            </p>

          <li>
            <p>
              Except as may otherwise be agreed by WLAC in writing, all Orders
              will be deemed “FOB Destination” (as defined in the California
              Uniform Commercial Code). Legal title to the Products will pass to
              WLAC upon WLAC&apos;s acceptance of the Products at the designated
              final destination, provided that the Products are delivered in
              good condition and conform to all representations. WLAC will not
              incur any liability for insuring or paying duty on the Products.
              Risk of loss shall not pass to WLAC until legal title passes.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              There shall be no changes or modifications to any Order, nor any
              under-shipment or over-shipment of quantities unless expressly
              agreed to in writing by authorized agents of both WLAC and
              Supplier. Supplier will promptly communicate to WLAC if any
              Products are on back-order and provide estimates and updates as to
              Product availability. Neither additional or different terms nor
              the furnishing by Supplier of additional documents shall modify
              the Order. Any and all such additional or different terms are
              rejected by WLAC, and WLAC&apos;s failure to object specifically
              to such additional or different terms will not be a waiver of
              these Terms and Conditions. Time is of the essence of any Order.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Supplier will not reject any Order submitted that complies with
              these Terms and Conditions unless Supplier has provided at least
              ninety (90) days prior written notice that it will not accept
              Orders after a specified date.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If Supplier reduces its regular selling price for any Product
              before shipment, Supplier agrees to apply the reduced price to all
              unshipped Orders for such Products. Price protection shall also be
              provided on special quotations issued by Supplier with a valid
              quote number and shall be good through one hundred twenty (120)
              days after date of quotation. No changes in price, quantity, unit
              of measure or modifications to any Order or Product are permitted
              except as maybe approved by WLAC in writing prior to shipment. No
              increased price for any Product shall be effective until thirty
              (30) days after WLAC receives written notice of such change.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              With respect to selection of carrier and freight costs, the Order
              shall specify either (a) “Prepaid”, in which event Supplier
              selects the carrier for delivery and the freight cost is included
              in the price of the Products; or (b) “Prepaid &amp; Add”, in which
              event Supplier selects the carrier for delivery but the freight
              cost for delivery is not included in the price of the Products and
              is added to the price on the Supplier&apos;s invoice; or (c)
              “Collect”, in which case the Order will specify the carrier for
              delivery or will provide instructions for Supplier to coordinate
              the carrier for delivery. In the absence of any specification in
              the Order, Supplier will ship all Product “Prepaid”.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Supplier agrees that WLAC need not inspect Products or packaging
              before re-sale, and that Supplier&apos;s warranties shall survive
              any inspection, installation, acceptance, and any payment by WLAC
              and its customers. Notice of defects in the Products or of any
              other breach by Supplier under the terms of any Order, or these
              Terms and Conditions, will be considered made within a reasonable
              time, if promptly made within thirty (30) days after being
              discovered by WLAC or after notification is given to WLAC by its
              customers or the user of the Product.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              WLAC&apos;s payment obligation shall arise only on the later of:
              (a) its receipt of Products; or (b) its receipt of a complete and
              correct invoice from Supplier for such Products. Unless otherwise
              provided in the Order or other written agreement, payment terms
              measured from such date shall be two percent (2%) discount for
              payment within fifteen (15) days, and net payment required in
              forty-five (45) days.
